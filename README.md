<h1>Ecoysystem Game</h1>

<h1>By: Ritika Kacholia</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This game is designed to be dependent on each player preference, incorporating features an ecoysystem needs. The player is able to choose certain environments with different biomes and cultures. Additional to that, the player gets to choose which animals exsist in their ecoysystem and what makes up the place they have created. There is complete freedom given to the player. This is played using the kinect, where players can phsically drag and drop different features to create their own world.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<div>
  <h3>Milestone #1: May 12, 2017 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have solid planning done by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li> Planning and outlining my project for the next month.</li>
    <li> Taking my previous code and rearranging it properly in order to have an array of objects, where I can specifically and intentionally control 1 at a time.</li>
    <li> Creating the array of one animal.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
 
<p>
  <h3>Milestone #2: May 19th, 2017 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have a small prototype by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li> Incorrporate more animals (objects) with arrays.</li>
    <li> Creating the game background and overall setup so that it visually starts to look as I had imagined.</li>
    <li> Start working on individual animal qualities. Specific functions for each animal which gives them different abilities. (flying, walking, eating, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
 
<div>
  <h3>Milestone #3: May 29th, 2017 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have iterated and improved on your prototype by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li> Finish specific animal adaptations / quatlities.</li>
    <li> Add buttons for choices including environment and location.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>My inspiration for this project came from my interest in science and being able to visualize what an ecosystem would be like. Additionally, I wanted to attempt to make a game like SimCity where the fate of the game is in the players hands. They choose what happens and each player can self customize their game. </p>
