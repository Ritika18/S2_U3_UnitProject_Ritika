<h2>Timeline</h2>

<div>
  <h3>Milestone #1: May 12, 2017 </h3>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> You should have solid planning done by the end of this milestone.
  <ul>
    <li> Planning and outlining my project for the next month.</li>
    <li> Taking my previous code and rearranging it properly in order to have an array of objects, where I can specifically and intentionally control 1 at a time.</li>
    <li> Creating the array of one animal.</li>
 </ul>

  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>My inspiration for this project came from my interest in science and being able to visualize what an ecosystem would be like. Additionally, I wanted to attempt to make a game like SimCity where the fate of the game is in the players hands. They choose what happens and each player can self customize their game. </p>
